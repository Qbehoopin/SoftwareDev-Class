# Loops let us repeat code without having to write it multiple times
# while loops = execute a block of code while a condition is true
#               used when we don't know beforehand how many times we need to iterate
#               more flexible than for loops
#               can create infinite loops (condition never becomes false)
#               break and continue statements can change a loop's behavior
#               can have an else block that executes when the condition becomes false
#               can have multiple conditions using logical operators (and, or, not)
#               can be nested (a loop inside a loop)
# Saves time and avoids errors. 
# Loops are used in games, web applications, and data analysis.
# while loop = repeat a block of code while a condition is true
#               condition is checked before executing the loop body
#               can use break and continue statements to change loop behavior

# while loop --- IGNORE ---

# Example 1: Count from 1 to 5
# Real life example that relates to Loops: 
# Brushing your teeth: you repeat the same action (brushing) until a certain condition is met (your teeth are clean).
# Practicing basketball: you repeat the same action (shooting hoops) until a certain condition is met (you make a basket).
# Listening to to a song on repeat: you repeat the same action (listening to the song) until a certain condition is met (you decide to stop).
