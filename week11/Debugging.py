# Debugging means identifying and fixing errors in your code.
# It is an essential skill for programmers to ensure their code runs correctly.
# Tips for Debugging:
# 1. Read Error Messages: They often provide clues about what went wrong and where.
# 2. Use Print Statements: Insert print statements to check the values of variables at different stages.
# 3. Check Logic: Ensure that the logic of your code is correct and that it follows the intended flow.
# 4. Isolate the Problem: Try to narrow down the section of code where the error occurs.
# 5. Test small Parts: Test small sections of code individually to identify issues.
# 6. Use Debugging Tools: Many IDEs (IDLE, VS Code, or Pycharm) have built-in debugging tools that allow setting breakpoints and stepping through code.

# Summary:
# Debugging is a critical part of programming that helps ensure your code works as intended.
# Errors are normal and expected during development, and learning to debug effectively will improve your coding skills.
# Debug sysematically and patiently to resolve issues in your code.
